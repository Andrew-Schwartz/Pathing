features
[ ] organize this by importance and difficulty for having other people work on it
[x] make all things in Point be in inches, not pixels. include the values displayed to user in gridpane
[ ] new PointMenuResult - Menu, show lots of details in popup for one box (x,y,vel,overrides)
[ ] CSVWriter makes backups
[ ] image location in config file
[ ] wheel paths based on vel and heading
[ ] backwards path
[ ] add jerk config
[ ] more special cases for velocity if center point is inside of robot
[ ] rotations to linear and vice versa not automatically do inches
[ ] Path class, take some of the dumb parts of Point and put them where they make sense
[ ] thread drawing paths
[ ] offset by length feature

bugs
[x] left and right graphs don't appear when there is more than one segment
[ ] combobox cant pick same thing 2x in a row

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

prior implemented features:
[x] calculate velocity
[x] config file
[x] vel chart, one per wheel
[x] generate curve according to time and time interval
[x] make Config static
[x] csv output dir in config file
[x] have path name be settable for use with csv file names
[x] save and open from a list of pointRows

prior fixed bugs
[x] NaNs in velocity
[x] config and textfields are empty -> NPE
[x] position should be measured in feet on chart
[x] accel on chart is wrong
[x] vel being calculated wrong
[x] delete last button deletes the most recently created pointrow, not the furthest down
[x] distance/time calculation wrong
[x] rotateAngle not working -- (theta, 90) = (theta, -90)
[x] left and right path seem backwards
[x] spamming "intercept?" on first point changes it's kinematics
[x] left and right acceleration too low
