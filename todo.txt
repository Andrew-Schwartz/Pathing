[x] = done in this commit
[.] = in progress
[ ] = not started

features
[ ] organize this by importance and difficulty for having other people work on it
[x] csv output dir in config file
[x] have path name be settable for use with csv file names
[ ] make all things in Point be in inches, not pixels. include the values displayed to user in gridpane
[ ] image location in config file
[ ] wheel paths based on vel and heading
[ ] backwards path
[ ] add jerk config
[ ] more special cases for velocity if center point is inside of robot
[ ] rotations to linear and vice versa not automatically do inches
[ ] Path class, take some of the dumb parts of Point and put them where they make sense
[ ] thread drawing paths
[ ] offset by length feature
[.] make polylines with map (no real purpose except that I want to be able to)

bugs
[x] delete last button deletes the most recently created pointrow, not the furthest down
[x] distance/time calculation wrong
[x] rotateAngle not working -- (theta, 90) = (theta, -90)
[x] left and right path seem backwards
[x] spamming "intercept?" on first point changes it's kinematics
[x] left and right acceleration too low
[ ] left and right graphs don't appear when there is more than one segment

prior implemented features:
[x] calculate velocity
[x] config file
[x] vel chart, one per wheel

[x] make Config static

prior fixed bugs
[x] NaNs in velocity
[x] config and textfields are empty -> NPE
