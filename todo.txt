features
[x] calculate velocity
[x] config file
[x] vel chart, one per wheel
[x] generate curve according to time and time interval
[/] redo velocity targeting (not always use full time)
[/] make Config static
[ ] thread drawing paths
[ ] paths end according to dist traveled
[ ] backwards path
[ ] make polylines with map
[ ] offset by length feature
[ ] wheel paths based on vel and heading
[ ] more special cases for velocity if center point is inside of robot
[ ] add jerk config
[ ] rotations to linear and vice versa not automatically do inches
[ ] Path class, take some of the dumb parts of Point and put them where they make sense

bugs
[x] NaNs in velocity
[x] config and textfields are empty -> NPE
[x] position should be measured in feet on chart
[x] accel on chart is wrong
[/] vel being calculated wrong
[ ] left and right path seem backwards
